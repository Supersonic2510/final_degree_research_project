# Final Degree Project

This repository contains five related subprojects that are part of my final degree project. Each subproject addresses a different aspect of the overall work, and together they form a cohesive whole.

## Subprojects Overview

1. [**2D Object Detection**](2d_object_detection/README.md): This subproject focuses on 2D object detection using the YOLOv8 model trained on the Mapillary Traffic Sign dataset.
2. [**3D Object Detection**](3d_object_detection/README.md): This subproject implements 3D object detection using the VoxelNext architecture, trained on the ONCE dataset, and leverages the OpenPCDet framework.
3. [**Manim Animations**](manim_animations/README.md): This subproject generates animations for the final thesis presentation using the Manim Community Edition library.
4. [**Report Plots**](report_plots/README.md): This subproject creates manually generated plots using a combination of Python libraries, showcasing various machine learning concepts and metrics.
5. [**Real-Time Simulation Visualizer**](real_time_simulation_visualizer/README.md): This subproject utilizes the Carla Open Simulator to test and visualize model performance in real-time using a Flask server and Websockets.

Each subproject has its own set of dependencies and specific instructions. Please refer to the `README.md` files within each subproject's directory for more detailed information.
